Description: Fit data to an ellipse, hyperbola, or parabola. Bootstrapping is available when needed. The conic curve can be rotated through an  arbitrary angle and the fit will still succeed. Helper functions are  provided to convert generator coefficients from one style to another, generate test data sets, rotate conic section parameters, and so on.
